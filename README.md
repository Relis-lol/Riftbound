# Riftbound TCG – Data Tracker

This project visualizes real-world Riftbound TCG booster openings and card data. It uses:

- `BoosterData.csv` and `CardData.csv` for raw data
- A normalized SQLite schema (`riftbound_portfolio.db`) for SQL-based analysis
- A clean, responsive front-end built with Bootstrap and PapaParse

## Use Case

This project serves as a showcase for handling structured datasets, offering download-ready SQL environments and clean data visualization.

## Files

- `BoosterData.csv` – Booster pack metadata
- `CardData.csv` – Individual card drops
- `riftbound_portfolio.db` – Full SQLite database
- `riftbound_schema.sql` – Matching SQL schema
- `index.html` – Main interface (for GitHub Pages or local use)
